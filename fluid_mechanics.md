## Continuity equations of fluid flow and heat transfer
The mass of the fluid is conserved.
Rate of increase of mass in fluid = Net rate of flow of mass into fluid element

The term on the left is representing the unsteady nature of a regime which equals the net rate of what enters our control volume and what exits.
